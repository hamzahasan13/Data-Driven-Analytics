### 2. Overview
Each year, millions of used cars are sold causing this market to be large and dynamic. Due to this reason, this market is complicated and requires complex Data Mining techniques to navigate through large amounts of data to find insights. Understanding these insights can help the buyers and companies evaluate the factors that influence the prices for used cars. This pricing analytics, can help individuals and companies to understand the market price for a car before publishing it as an ad online. Companies can maximize their profits and boost their financial metrics in a competitive market by using data mining and machine learning algorithms to sell used cars effectively.

### 3. Goal
The goal of this project is to generate insights using Exploratory Data Analysis and see what variables affect the pricing of the used car. Secondly, the aim is to use the historical data to make predictions on the price of the used car using Regression. This model can then be deployed to predict real world cases of used cars and propel data driven decision making.
